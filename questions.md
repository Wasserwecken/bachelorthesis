# What is the problem
There is no common or standarized workflow of how to analyse and recreate realistic surfaces as procedural textures.

# Why should it be solved
Not knowing a workflow and teqnuiqes can limit creativity. Also procedural textures may are not beginner friendly to programm.

# What is the solution to the problem
A solution can be categorising the structure of procedual textures, common tasks, requirements and visual requests. By that mathematical functions can be suggested to be used for certain tasks.

# What has to be done to solve the problem
Natural Materials have to be breaked down to create a abstract categorisation. After that, mathematical functions or teqniques can be named which will help to replicate a certain pattern or effect

# How do you show that the solution is a good solution to the problem
checking how many materials will fit in the categorisation, testing by artists.
Check which materials are special and will fall out of the concept.
