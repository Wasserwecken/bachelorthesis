# Analysis of procedural materials within fragment shaders
I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Daniel Scherzer and M.Sc. Dennis Reimer.

## Abstract
Render applications that offer shading interfaces for
objects can be used to create entire procedural materials
without dependencies to textures or other external
references. It is assumed that these interfaces work like
fragment shaders without access to buffers and same
restrictions to evaluate surface information at arbitrary
points. The process of creating such materials can be
complex, time consuming and requires an understanding
of the underlying algorithms. The thesis aims to create
an understanding for surfaces in general, abstract
technical knowledge to make it more accessible and
structurize the workflow of the creation.
